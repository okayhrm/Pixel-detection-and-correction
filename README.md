Detection and Correction of Pixelated Images

Overview
This project aims to develop an efficient, lightweight algorithm capable of detecting and correcting pixelated images. The main goal is to create a solution that can process high-resolution images (1920x1080) in real-time, making it suitable for applications that require high-speed image analysis, such as video streaming and live broadcasting.


Objectives
Detection of Pixelated Images: Design an algorithm or a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an image is pixelated. The model should be able to run at a minimum of 30 frames per second (FPS) and ideally at 60 FPS, ensuring minimal false positives even in scenarios where pixelated images are rare.
Correction of Pixelated Images: Develop an algorithm to improve the quality of pixelated images, restoring lost information and enhancing image clarity. This process, known as JPEG restoration, should be capable of running at least 20 FPS.
Key Metrics
Detection Model: The performance will be measured using accuracy, recall. The algorithm should achieve at least 90% accuracy with minimal false positives.
Correction Model: The quality of restoration will be evaluated using metrics such as LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) and PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
Project Components
1. Data Preparation
The first step involves collecting and preparing a dataset of high-resolution images. This dataset will be divided into two categories: non-pixelated images (class 0) and pixelated images (class 1). The pixelated images are generated by applying a pixelation effect to a subset of the original high-resolution images.

2. Detection Model
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to detect pixelated images. Transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model is employed due to its efficiency and small model size. The model's architecture is fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy while maintaining a lightweight structure suitable for real-time applications.

3. Correction Model
The correction model is inspired by the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) architecture. This model takes pixelated images as input and outputs enhanced images with improved quality. The model is trained to minimize the mean squared error between the corrected images and the original high-resolution images.

4. Evaluation
The models are evaluated on a separate validation set to ensure they generalize well to unseen data. Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall are calculated for the detection model. For the correction model, metrics like LPIPS and PSNR are used to assess the quality of the restored images.

5. Optimization
To meet the real-time processing requirements, both models are optimized for speed and efficiency. Techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and hardware acceleration (using GPUs) are considered to enhance the inference speed.
